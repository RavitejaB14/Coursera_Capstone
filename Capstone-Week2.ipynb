Ignore cells with a borough that is Not assigned.\nMore than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page, you will notice that M5A is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: Harbourfront and Regent Park. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma as shown in row 11 in the above table.\nIf a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough. So for the 9th cell in the table on the Wikipedia page, the value of the Borough and the Neighborhood columns will be Queen's Park.\nClean your Notebook and add Markdown cells to explain your work and any assumptions you are making.\nIn the last cell of your notebook, use the .shape method to print the number of rows of your dataframe.\n4. Submit a link to your Notebook on your Github repository. (10 marks)\n\nNote: There are different website scraping libraries and packages in Python. One of the most common packages is BeautifulSoup. Here is the package's main documentation page: http://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nThe package is so popular that there is a plethora of tutorials and examples of how to use it. Here is a very good Youtube video on how to use the BeautifulSoup package: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k\n\nUse the BeautifulSoup package or any other way you are comfortable with to transform the data in the table on the Wikipedia page into the above pandas dataframe\n\nBI Link\n\nNow that you have built a dataframe of the postal code of each neighborhood along with the borough name and neighborhood name, in order to utilize the Foursquare location data, we need to get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood.\n\nIn an older version of this course, we were leveraging the Google Maps Geocoding API to get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood. However, recently Google started charging for their API: http://geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/, so we will use the Geocoder Python package instead: https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/index.html.\n\nThe problem with this Package is you have to be persistent sometimes in order to get the geographical coordinates of a given postal code. So you can make a call to get the latitude and longitude coordinates of a given postal code and the result would be None, and then make the call again and you would get the coordinates. So, in order to make sure that you get the coordinates for all of our neighborhoods, you can run a while loop for each postal code. Taking postal code M5G as an example, your code would look something like this:\n\n\u0001\u0001\nGiven that this package can be very unreliable, in case you are not able to get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods using the Geocoder package, here is a link to a csv file that has the geographical coordinates of each postal code: http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\n\nUse the Geocoder package or the csv file to create the following dataframe:\n\n\nImportant Note: There is a limit on how many times you can call geocoder.google function. It is 2500 times per day. This should be way more than enough for you to get acquainted with the package and to use it to get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods in the Toronto.",
